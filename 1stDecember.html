This is the continuation of that, just not for the same reason. <br> Like ever since we met, you have always been sooo like cool and wonderful and such a good friend to me, and me have never been able to give you what you deserve and am sincerly sorry for that. I hope this year, 2023, will go better and i will make sure i never repeat the mistakes i made.</p></center></b>
