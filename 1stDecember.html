        <center><b><p>This website creation was orignally started ages ago by me for our some month anniversary but my computer and website development modules got in such a bad condition that I could never resume. Today i decided I should finally finish this website and send it to you, even tho it doesnt matter now, its too late am i right?. <br> Like ever since we met, you have always been sooo like cool and wonderful and such a good friend to me, but on the other hand I have never been able to give you what you deserve and am sincerly sorry for that. I hope this year, 2023, will go better and i will make sure to never repeat the mistakes i made last year, this website is just made to show you how much affection i have for you darlin' <br> Your sense of humour, style, fashion and even the way of talking are so unique and wonderful that it feels like im talking to an angel :) ik there's no point in making this now cause we broke up :tear_emoji: but i guess good luck with your future, your life is going to be filled with joy and love. im feeling unfortunate that i wont be able to provide it to you, ill definately improve and get good enough that one day, i will be the one, the one you need. <br><br> Made with lots of love, your ex boyfriend and close friend, Ikshit <3</p></center></b>
